bindToController
================

As discussed in [isolate scope properties in controller context via controllerAs](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/7645)

Since controllerAs is gaining a lot of momentum as of late, another feature was added in the latest 1.3.0 version, which is bindToController.

I decided to make a quick little demo, to observe how it works. I made an article about this on my blog at [flipjs.io](http://flipjs.io)
